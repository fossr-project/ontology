It defines key elements in a survey—Question, Variable, Participant, and UserAnswer—and their relationships. Supporting classes include Language (survey language), Condition (defines conditions for displaying questions), and Attribute (describes participant characteristics).

This ontology supports reasoning, querying, and analysis of survey definitions and data report, enabling applications in social sciences and data analysis."""@en ;
